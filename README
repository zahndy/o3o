o3o is a C# WPF Twitter client

as of now it works but still needs a lot of tweaks, refactoring and features added.

you need to have OpenAL installed and ffmpeg.exe needs to be present in o3o's directory

some of its features:
- multi user support(single timeline for multiple users).
- simple changable layout.
- BLAZING FAST, tweets are streamed, meaning twitter pushes them to the client, when you post something on the website, it should appear in the client under a second.
- aero based, transparent aero like ui.
- customisations, you can change the color of links, the opaciity of the tweet background etc.
- image caching.
- spellcheck.
- single click retweet
- remembers where you placed the window the last time you used it( if it ever goes offscreen just select it from the taskbar and use win+arrow to move it in view)
- you can select where you want the notofication to show up.
- you can load your own notification sound

currently the amount of tweets displayed at the same time is limted to 200, to keep memory and performance in sane regions.
